## About

AstroHammer is a small project hosted by the galaxy group in the Department of 
Astronomy, Tsinghua University. Its main target is to provide
computer-science-related introduction material for astronomy beginners. 
The features of this project include:

- A large range of topic is covered, from organizing your first project, 
  first time working on a machine, managing your work environment, 
  programming, using famous and useful third-party libraries,
  writing language-specific libraries,
  publishing data/software, to developing interesting GUI-based softwares.
- The basic parts of those topics are presented, with emphasis on the 
  frequent usage in Astronomy-related situation. Carefully 
  chosen "Futher Reading" materials are provided as the starting-point 
  to master them.

To help readers quickly dive into those topics, the following resources 
are provided:

- This [Github](https://github.com/ChenYangyao/project-astro-hammer) repository: all material (code samples, data samples, 
  lecture videos, problem sets and solutions) are hosted here.
- The lecture notes are served in [Read the Docs](https://project-astro-hammer.readthedocs.io/).
- Regular online meetings will be organize to introduce these topics. 
  The meetings will loop over all the topics periodically (1~2 years per loop),
  everyone is welcomed. See below for a Schedule.

The project, currently, is organized by Kai Wang ([kosmoswalker.com](https://www.kosmoswalker.com/)) 
and Yangyao Chen ([chenyangyao.com](https://www.chenyangyao.com/)). We welcome everyone 
to contribute to this project. For example: 

- Raise a Github issus for any problem encountered when learning.
- Start a Pull Request to help improve the quality of the present material, or 
  add new topics you'd like to learn from us.
- Register as a reporter in the online meeting to share your ideas, tools 
  or anything that is technically interesting.
