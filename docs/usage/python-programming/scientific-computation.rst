Topics:

- numpy
- GPU computation (CuPy, torch or tensorflow). 
  Consider that the gpus on Metis are usually free, CUDA based GPU-accelerated 
  computing is worth to metion. The pacakge CuPy is easy to use. (2021-12-07, advice from Tao Jing)
- scipy (optimization, differentiation, integration, interpolation, statistics)
- pandas
- sklearn
- deep learning (keras or pytorch)
