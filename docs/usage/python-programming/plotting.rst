Plotting

Topics:

- matplotlib
- plotly: The js based plotting package such as plotly is a good supplement to matplotlib. 
  (i.e. when you want to rotate 3D plot to explore the 3D structure of data in jupyter notebook, 
  the plotly will give you better experience) (2021-12-07, advice from Tao Jing)
